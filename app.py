Extract the main ideas and technical concepts discussed in the transcript
Avoid Context-Specific References:
Do not include questions tied to the video or module itself. Instead, create questions that are conceptually relevant and independent of the video context.
Encourage Application and Understanding:
Frame questions to encourage understanding of concepts and their applications
Diverse Question Types:
Include a variety of question types, such as:
Conceptual: What are the key components of a chatbot?
Analytical: How does memory improve user experience in chatbots?
Comparative: How are chatbots with internet functionality different from regular chatbots?
Avoid Repetition:
Ensure each question is unique and covers different aspects of the transcript.
Generalize Use Cases:
When referencing use cases, frame them in a broader context
Maintain Clarity:
Keep questions clear, concise, and relevant to the transcript's concepts.
Focus on Learning Objectives:
Ensure questions align with learning objectives such as understanding chatbots, their components, their features, and their use in generative AI applications."""
